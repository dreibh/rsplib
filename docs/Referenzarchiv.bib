	abstract = "{Providing fault tolerancy is crucial for a growing number of IP-based applications. There exist a lot of proprietary solutions for this problem, but free alternatives are rare.
Currently, the IETF RSerPool working group is standardizing a protocol suite for Reliable Server Pooling, which copes with the challenge of providing high availability by using redundant servers. Servers for the same service are grouped into a server pool. A server in a pool is called pool element (PE), a user of a pool is called pool user (PU). When a PE fails, its PUs simply select another one from the pool and initiates an application-specific failover procedure. This fail-over is supported by the RSerPool protocol suite. Each PE registers at a name server and is then continously supervised by that specific name server. All name servers of an operational scope provide a redundant system for name resolution from pool handles to transport addresses of pool elements to pool users. RSerPool uses SCTP to provide network fault tolerance and address scoping functionality.
The RSPLIB is a prototype implementation of the RSerPool protocol suite, developed under the GNU Public License in cooperation between Siemens and the Computer Networking Technology Group of the University of Essen. It currently runs under Linux, FreeBSD and Darwin.
Our paper covers aspects of designing and implementing highly available applications using RSerPool with our RSPLIB implementation. First, we will give an introduction to the RSerPool protocol suite and an overview of the RSPLIB components. Then, we describe the RSPLIB API, especially focussing on the implementation of pool element and pool user programs to provide high reliability. Furthermore, we show our current implementation status and future plans. This will be followed by a short look on the problems that can arise when the RSerPool architecture is used. Finally, we give an example how RSerPool can be used to realize highly available services. And last but not least, we show how distributed computing architectures can make use of the RSerPool architecture.}",

At the heart of this new mobility concept is the reliable transport protocol SCTP, with an enhancement for dynamic address reconfiguration. This is described in this paper. A session layer based on the reliable server pooling (RSerPool) protocol suite provides for sessionmonitoring and control. The suggested solution is transparent for applications,requires no changes in the network infrastructure, and is evaluated with a real-world implementation.
Finally, we present first results from the application of this mobility concept to different mobility scenarios. These were obtained from working SCTP and RSerPool implementations that have been developed within our group.}",

While availability is one main aspect of RSerPool, load distribution is another. Since most of the time a server pool system runs without component failures, optimal performance is an extremely important issue for the productivity and cost-efficiency of the system. In this paper, we therefore focus especially on the load distribution performance of RSerPool in scenarios without failures, presenting a quantitative performance comparison of the different load distribution strategies (called pool policies) defined in the RSerPool specifications. Based on the results, we propose some new pool policies providing significant performance enhancements compared to those currently defined in the standards documents.}",

Außerdem wollen wir vorstellen, welche speziellen Funktionalitäten RSerPool bietet um den Nutzen eines Serverpools sowohl für dessen Betreiber als auch für den Anwender zu optimieren: die Möglichkeit zur vollautomatischen Konfiguration von Komponenten und die Festlegung pool-spezifischer Serverauswahlregeln. Diese Funktionalitäten werden wir am Beispiel der Anwendung von RSerPool für Real-Time Distributed Computing verdeutlichen.
Im zweiten Teil unseres Vortrages werden wir auf unsere Open Source Implementation rsplib eingehen. Neben dem Aufbau der einzelnen Komponenten werden wir insbesondere auch interessante Details der Implementation vorstellen und beschreiben, wie wir auftretende Probleme erfolgreich lösen konnten. Insbesondere wollen wir dabei auch unsere gesammelten Erfahrungen beim Erstellen von auf unterschiedlichen Betriebssystemen und Hardware lauffähiger Software vorstellen. Im Anschluß daran wenden wir uns kurz dem API der rsplib zu und zeigen, wie eigene Programme mit dessen Hilfe hochverfügbar gemacht werden können. Neben neuer, direkt auf RSerPool basierender Software, berücksichtigen wir dabei insbesondere auch die Anpassung bestehender Applikationen und stellen Möglichkeiten zur Migration vor. Zum besseren Verständnis werden sämtliche Beschreibungen von Code-Beispielen begleitet.
Zum Abschluß stellen wir noch unsere Beispielanwendung vor, ein System zum verteilten Berechnen von Fraktalgrafiken.

In our paper, we present an approach to add distance-awareness to the RSerPool architecture, based on features of the SCTP transport protocol. This approach is examined and evaluated by simulations.

VoIP-Vermittlungsanlagen zur Weiterleitung von Notrufen oder e-Commerce-Anwendungen sind nicht akzeptabel. Zur Sicherstellung der Verfügbarkeit von Diensten bei Geräte- und Netzwerkausfällen müssen diese Komponenten redundant ausgelegt sein. Spezialisierte Redundanzlösungen – insbesondere z.B. für Web-Server – gibt es zwar viele, eine einheitliche, für viele Dienste nutzbare Lösung fehlte jedoch noch. Reliable Server Pooling, abgekürzt RSerPool, ist ein Rahmenwerk zur Bereitstellung hochverfügbarer Anwendungen durch redundante Server, es befindet sich zur Zeit in der Standardisierung durch die IETF RSerPool-Arbeitsgruppe. Im RSerPool-Konzept werden Server, welche den gleichen Dienst anbieten, zu einem Pool zusammengefaßt. Neben der Hauptaufgabe – der Verfügbarkeit von Diensten – ist insbesondere auch die Lastverteilung ein wichtiges Anwendungsgebiet von RSerPool.
Im Rahmen eines Forschungsprojektes haben wir -- die Arbeitsgruppe Technik der Rechnernetze am Institut für Experimentelle Mathematik der Universität Duisburg-Essen -- im Jahre 2002 damit begonnen, einen plattformunabhängigen RSerPool-Prototypen als Open Source unter GPL-Lizenz zu entwickeln. Mittlerweile wird unser Projekt durch die Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) gefördert. Unser System läuft zur Zeit unter Linux, FreeBSD, Darwin (MacOS X) und Solaris, wobei die Unterstützung für weitere Plattformen – insbesondere auch für Embedded-Systeme – geplant ist. Als einzige vollständige Implementierung des zukünftigen RSerPool-Standards sind wir Referenzimplementierung der IETF RSerPool-Arbeitsgruppe und wirken mit Tests und Forschungsarbeiten aktiv in der Standardisierung mit.
In unserem Vortrag geben wir zunächst eine kurze Einführung zu RSerPool. Dabei wollen wir insbesondere auch die Merkmale verdeutlichen, die RSerPool von existierenden Lösungen – wie Linux Virtual Server (LVS) oder dem kommerziellen Cisco Distributed Director – unterscheiden. Außerdem wollen wir zeigen, welche speziellen Funktionalitäten RSerPool bietet um den Nutzen eines Serverpools sowohl für dessen Betreiber als auch für den Anwender zu optimieren: die Möglichkeit zur vollautomatischen Konfiguration von Komponenten und die Festlegung pool-spezifischer Serverauswahlregeln. Diese Funktionalitäten werden wir am Beispiel einer Anwendung von RSerPool für Real-Time Distributed Computing verdeutlichen.
Im zweiten Teil unseres Vortrags werden wir auf unsere Open Source Implementierung rsplib eingehen. Neben dem Aufbau der einzelnen Komponenten werden wir insbesondere auch interessante Details der Implementierung vorstellen und beschreiben, wie wir auftretende Probleme erfolgreich lösen konnten. Insbesondere wollen wir dabei auch unsere gesammelten Erfahrungen beim Erstellen von auf unterschiedlichen Betriebssystemen (Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS X, Solaris) und Hardware (x86, x64, PPC) lauffähiger Software vorstellen. Im Anschluß daran zeigen wir, wie das RSerPool-API dazu genutzt werden kann, eigene Anwendungen hochverfügbar zu machen und die Möglichkeiten zur Lastverteilung im Pool verwendet werden können. Ein Schwerpunkt dieser Einführung wird dabei insbesondere die einfache und effiziente Realisierung des Failover-Mechanisms sein, d.h. des Verfahrens zur Wiederherstellung eines Sitzungszustandes auf einem neuen Server nach Ausfall des alten. Im Besonderen werden wir dabei zeigen, welche Fähigkeiten RSerPool und sein API mitbringen um dieses – teilweise recht komplexe Thema – in vielen Fällen übersichtlich und mit wenigen Zeilen Programmcode zu lösen: Hochverfügbarkeit für eigene Anwendungen muß nicht kompliziert sein!
Zum Abschluß stellen wir noch unsere Beispielanwendung vor, ein System zum verteilten Berechnen von Fraktalgrafiken. Mit diesem System lassen sich die grundlegenden Eigenschaften von RSerPool – welche im Vortrag vorgestellt wurden – sehr anschaulich demonstrieren: die Verwaltung dynamischer Pools, Lastverteilung und Failover bei Serverausfall. Selbstverständlich werden wir unser Beispielsystem beim Vortrag auch in der Praxis demonstrieren, bei Vorhandensein eines Internetzugangs sogar mit einem Szenario aus weltweit verteilten Ressourcen.}",

Server redundancy has to take load distribution and load balancing into consideration since these issues are crucial for the system performance.
There has already been some research on the server selection strategies of RSerPool for different application scenarios. In particular, it has been shown that the adaptive Least Used selection usually provides the best performance. This strategy requires up-to-date load information of the services, which has to be propagated among distributed pool management components. But network delay (which is realistic for systems being widely distributed to achieve availability in case of regional servers failures) as well as caching of information may both lead to obsolete load information. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to analyse and evaluate the performance of a new server selection rule to cope with update latencies. Especially, we will also analyse the impact of different workload parameters on the performance of the new server selection strategy.}",

This article introduces our concept of a novel network QoS device being located in network edge nodes. It provides a solution for relaxed QoS guarantees to certain flows on a congested link by focussing packet discard on selected flows. However, unlike for IntServ solutions like RSVP, our approach only requires minimal signalling and therefore provides both efficiency and scalability. We furthermore provide a quantitative performance evaluation of our QoS device by using simulations.}",

To support the development and operation of such applications, the IETF has recently defined a new standard for a common server redundancy and session failover framework: Reliable Server Pooling~(RSerPool). The basic ideas of the RSerPool framework are not entirely new, but their combination into a single, resource-efficient and unified architecture is. Service availability achieved by the redundancy of servers directly leads to the issues of load distribution and load balancing, which are both important for the performance of RSerPool systems. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the performance of such systems with respect to the load balancing strategy required by the service application.
In this article -- which is an extended version of our paper~[1] -- we first present an overview of the RSerPool architecture with a focus on the component failure detection and handling mechanisms. We will also shortly introduce the underlying SCTP protocol and its link redundancy features. After that, we will present a quantitative, application-independent performance analysis of the failure detection and session failover mechanisms provided by RSerPool, with respect to important adaptive and non-adaptive load balancing strategies.}",

In this paper, we describe our approach of combining CMT with the idea of Resource Pooling~(RP) in order to achieve a performance improvement over non-CMT transfer while still remaining fair to concurrent flows on congested links. Unlike existing approaches which adapt classic TCP to a multi-homed CMT protocol, our approach does not depend on specific characteristics of TCP.

In this paper, we propose our approach for breaking up the functionalities of the OSI Transport Layer into the concept so called functional building blocks. Each functional building block provides a particular service, which -- in interaction with the other functional building blocks -- is able to provide a service similar to the classic OSI Transport Layer. The concept allows for easy removal, replacement or addition of existing and new functional building blocks to adapt the service to state-of-the-art and future requirements, particularly including multi-path transport and QoS.}",

Various testbeds have been built up to fill this gap. Most of these testbeds also support link emulation, i.e.\ using software to mimic the characteristic behaviour of certain kinds of network links (like bandwidth bottlenecks or error-prone radio transmissions). The most popular link emulation systems are the Linux-based NetEm and Dummynet, which are e.g.\ applied on the IP~layer of Planet-Lab and various other testbeds.

Having multiple Internet access paths, it seems straightforward to utilise them simultaneously in order to improve payload throughput by so-called Concurrent Multipath Transfer~(CMT). Currently, CMT extensions for the two important Internet Transport Layer protocols -- Multipath-TCP~(MPTCP) for TCP and CMT-SCTP for SCTP -- are in the focus of IETF standardisation. A challenge -- which is currently very actively discussed in the IETF context -- is congestion control for these CMT protocols.
Based on the idea of Resource Pooling~(RP), two approaches are currently discussed in the IETF: our own approach CMT/RP for CMT-SCTP as well as the MPTCP congestion control for MPTCP. Both approaches only have been roughly tested yet -- mostly in similar path setups, i.e.\ paths having almost the same QoS characteristics, using "their" protocol. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to compare the existing approaches. Particularly, we also analyse more challenging scenarios containing dissimilar paths, i.e.\ paths having differing characteristics. Our goal is to provide insight into the different approaches, to support the IETF standardisation activities on CMT.}",

Concurrent Multipath Transfer~(CMT) denotes the Transport Layer approach to utilise multiple network paths simultaneously, in order to improve application payload throughput. Currently, CMT is a quite hot topic in the IETF -- in form of the Multipath~TCP~(MPTCP) and CMT-SCTP protocol extensions for TCP and SCTP. However, an important issue is still not fully solved: multipath congestion control.
In order to support the IETF activities, we have set up a distributed Internet testbed for CMT evaluation. An important tool -- which we have developed for multi-protocol Transport Layer performance analysis -- is the Open Source
NetPerfMeter tool-chain. It supports the parametrisation and processing of measurement runs as well as results collection, post-processing and plotting. However, its key feature is to support multiple Transport Layer protocols, which makes a quantitative comparison of different protocols -- including state-of-the-art features like CMT -- possible. In this paper, we first introduce
NetPerfMeter and then show a proof-of-concept performance evaluation of CMT congestion controls which are currently discussed in the IETF standardisation process of CMT-SCTP.}",

Our approach differs from the concepts found in prior work, which focus on special parts of the problems (such as the application, the service or the event) by staggering back a couple of steps and trying to see the requirements from a different perspective. Our concept -- which is denoted as Encapsulated Responsibility-Centric Architecture Model~(ERiCA) -- focuses on determining the responsibilities by using different planes in addition to a partitioning of the network into different decision domains.

In consequence, this results in a growing demand for utilising multiple Internet accesses simultaneously, in order to improve application payload throughput during normal operation. Multi-path Transport Layer protocol extensions -- like Multi-Path~TCP~(MPTCP) for TCP and Concurrent Multipath Transfer for SCTP~(CMT-SCTP) -- allow applications to make use of such network topologies.
However, since TCP -- which constitutes the basis of most Internet applications -- and its congestion control procedures have been designed under the assumption of single-homed sites, fairness issues may arise by the usage of multipath transport. These issues are addressed by advanced congestion control approaches, which have already been examined by simulations. However, real-life network measurements are missing. In this paper, we perform an experimental proof-of-concept evaluation of several multipath congestion control strategies, which are currently under discussion within the IETF in the context of MPTCP as well as CMT-SCTP. Particularly, we validate effects that have been observed in simulations, in order to trigger further discussions on multipath congestion control.

In consequence, there is a rising demand for so-called multi-path transfer, which utilizes all of these interfaces simultaneously in order to maximize the payload throughput of applications. Currently, this so-called multi-path transfer is very actively discussed by the IETF, in form of the Multi-Path TCP~(MPTCP) extension for TCP as well as the Concurrent Multi-path Transfer extension for SCTP~(CMT-SCTP). Their larger-scale deployment in the Internet is expected for the near future.
A key issue that prevents the standardization of these approaches is the fairness to concurrent TCP flows. A multi-path transfer should behave "TCP-friendly", i.e.\ cause no harm to the performance of the very widely deployed TCP-based applications. In this paper, we first extend the notion of "fairness" from single-path transport to multi-path transport. Furthermore, we introduce the relevant congestion control approaches in the IETF context for single-path as well as multi-path transfer. We simulatively analyze these approaches in a couple of interesting network configuration scenarios, in order to show their behavior with special regard to the fairness definitions. Particularly, we also point out items of further discussion which are the result of the current approaches.}",

While it has originally been built for less critical services like e-mail and file transfer, it is nowadays also increasingly often used for availability-critical services like e.g.\ e-commerce or healthcare. Clearly, the reachability of such services must be ensured by so-called multi-homing of endpoints. That is, endpoints are simultaneously connected to multiple Internet Service Providers~(ISP) to provide redundancy. If one ISP has problems, it is intended that the connection to another one still works. However, such assumptions have never been verified in real, large-scale setups.
The intention of the NorNet project is to build up a realistic Internet testbed for multi-homing. In this paper, we describe the design of NorNet with focus on the implementation of its fixed-line part: NorNet Core. This paper is intended to give researchers an overview of its mode of operation, its capabilities as well as its interesting feature realisations. The knowledge about these items is very useful to plan own experiments in the NorNet testbed.}",

This so-called multi-homing also leads to the desire of utilising multiple network paths simultaneously, in order to improve application payload throughput. Clearly, this so-called multi-path transfer feature is also very useful for the transport of multimedia contents, particularly when a single network access alone is not fast enough to fulfil the bandwidth requirements of the application.
In many cases, multimedia transport is also sensitive for delays and packet losses. However, the focus of the current multi-path transfer approaches has been on bandwidth only. In order to tackle this challenge, our paper introduces two new send strategies to map payload data to different wireless paths. Finally, by using measurements, we show that a significant performance improvement for delay and loss-sensitive applications can be achieved in comparison to the existing approaches.}",

Nowadays, a large number of important services -- for instance e-commerce, healthcare and many others -- depend on the availability of the underlying network. Clearly, service interruptions due to network problems may have a severe impact. On the long way towards the Future Internet, the complexity will grow even further. Therefore, new ideas and concepts must be evaluated thoroughly, and particularly in realistic, real-world Internet scenarios, before they can be deployed for production networks. For this purpose, various testbeds -- for instance PlanetLab, GpENI or G-Lab -- have been established and are intensively used for research. However, all of these testbeds lack the support for so-called multi-homing.
Multi-homing denotes the connection of a site to multiple Internet service providers, in order to achieve redundancy. Clearly, with the need for network availability, there is a steadily growing demand for multi-homing. The idea of the NorNet Core project is to establish a Future Internet research testbed with multi-homed sites, in order to allow researchers to perform experiments with multi-homed systems. Particular use cases for this testbed include realistic experiments in the areas of multi-path routing, load balancing, multi-path transport protocols, overlay networks and network resilience. In this paper, we introduce the NorNet Core testbed as well as its architecture.}",

These multiple interfaces can be utilized simultaneously by a multi-path transport protocol to provide bandwidth aggregation or reliability. However, in order to design efficient multi-path scheduling and congestion control strategies, it is crucial to understand the behaviour and properties of the underlying paths first. WLAN links have already been studied extensively in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on Mobile Broadband~(MBB) networks that are in use today. We utilized
NorNet Edge nodes that are connected to up to five different 3G ISPs (UMTS and CDMA2000), hence, providing a realistic view on the QoS characteristics that are experienced by end-users of these MBB networks. We present QoS characteristics (e.g.\ bandwidth, delay and loss) and discuss our observations. Our results shed light on what a multi-path transport endpoint has to expect -- and to efficiently cope with -- when using today's MBB networks as transport paths.}",

A transport protocol can make use of this best effort service to provide a suitable service to its applications. Also, its congestion control is responsible for a fair distribution of the resources within the Internet. However, background data transfer applications (like file sharing or update fetching) do not require "best effort", they in fact could use a "lower-than-best-effort" service to leave resources to more important applications if needed. For this purpose, the Low Extra Delay Background Transport~(LEDBAT) algorithm has been standardized by the IETF.
Nowadays, multi-homing is becoming increasingly common in modern networks and several approaches to exploit this feature (e.g.\ CMT-SCTP, MPTCP) have evolved that are able to combine resources of multiple paths. For background traffic oriented algorithms like LEDBAT, this feature could be of great use, too, i.e.\ by increasing the overall bandwidth while shifting the transmission away from paths which are used by other flows. This could be particularly useful for non-critical bulk transfers in data centres. In this paper, we introduce our approach LEDBAT for Multi-Path -- denoted as LEDBAT-MP -- and analyze its performance by simulations. With this paper, we want to highlight some generic design questions and start a discussion on how a solid universal background multi-path congestion control strategy should behave.}",

In this paper, we introduce a novel distributed monitoring system with Sensor nodes located in Norway, Germany and China that allow to detect SIP-based attacks from the Internet. Based on experiences from experiments spanning several years, we propose a new setup which allows simple and straightforward addition of new remote observation points. We have deployed this setup in the NorNet testbed and highlight its advantages compared to a previous setup with physically distributed Sensors. We also present results from a 45~day field test with 13 observation points. These results confirm the advantages of a widely distributed monitoring setup and give some new insights into the behavior of the attackers.}",

Not so many Internet service providers offer direct IPv6 connectivity to their customers, yet. Clearly, when IPv6 is available to customers, they expect that IPv6 offers at least the same -- or even better -- stability of connections in comparison to IPv4. The main goal of this paper is to investigate whether this is true today.
In our paper, we present up-to-date measurement results on the stability of IPv4 and IPv6 paths in the real Internet, based on machines that are distributed over a large geographical area, as part of the NorNet Core testbed infrastructure for multi-homed systems. The measurements not only cover high-speed research networks, but also consumer-grade ADSL connections -- i.e. the ISP connection types of "normal" end-users -- as well as a broad range of different ISPs. The measurements show that IPv6 paths are less stable than corresponding IPv4 paths. We also find that the use of load balancing is more prevalent in IPv6 than in IPv4.}",

To avoid the Internet access becoming a single point of failure, redundancy by multi-homing -- i.e.\ simultaneous access to multiple Internet service providers~(ISP) -- is becoming increasingly common as well. Multi-homing leads to the desire to utilise all network attachment points simultaneously, which is e.g.\ provided by the Multi-Path TCP~(MPTCP) extension for TCP. MPTCP is still under development by researchers and standardisation in the IETF. Particularly, it is necessary to evaluate MPTCP under realistic Internet conditions.
NorNet Core is the world's first, large-scale Internet testbed for multi-homed systems and applications. It is therefore a useful platform for evaluating MPTCP. In this paper, we therefore present our NorNet Core extension that adds MPTCP support to the testbed. Particularly, our extension is now available to all users of NorNet Core as well, which significantly reduces the effort of MPTCP researchers to evaluate MPTCP and its improvements. In a proof of concept, we furthermore show the strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art MPTCP in NorNet Core, in a configuration covering 29~ISP connections at 14~sites in 5~different countries.}",

Clearly, a key feature of this testbed is to work in the real-world Internet. That is, it is especially desired to expose experiments to real Internet behaviour like background traffic. However, for the researcher, it is necessary to actually know how paths -- being used for an experiment -- actually behave: Are the paths actually working? How are the round-trip times among sites over different ISPs, etc.. How did the behaviour change over time?
To provide such information to the researchers, we have designed and developed a maintenance and monitoring infrastructure for the NorNet Core testbed. In this paper, we will first introduce this infrastructure. Furthermore, we will demonstrate its usefulness with some useful, real-world examples.

Furthermore, the growing popularity of multi-path transport, especially Multi-Path TCP~(MPTCP) that is the extension of the well-known Transmission Control Protocol~(TCP), leads to the question of whether this identity duality can be utilized for improving application performance in addition to providing resilience. In this paper, we first investigate the AS-level congruency of IPv4 and IPv6 paths in the Internet. We find that more than 60\% of the current IPv4 and IPv6 AS-paths are non-congruent at the AS-level, which motivates us to explore how MPTCP can utilize the IPv4/IPv6 identity duality to improve data transfer performance. Our results show that MPTCP, even with a single dual-stack Internet connection, can significantly improve the end-to-end performance when the underlying paths are non-congruent. The extent of the improvement can reach up to the aggregate of the IPv4 and IPv6 bandwidth.}",

However, there is nowadays also a growing demand for transmitting big amounts of data in the background, namely background transport that uses spare capacity, but with minimal effect on other traffic. For instance, systems can proactively download content that the user/system would need in the future (e.g.\ update packages, video files, etc.). Efforts have therefore been made in the IETF for the sake of such a service with Low Extra Delay Background Traffic~(LEDBAT) congestion control. While LEDBAT works in some cases, there are however known situations where it causes serious performance problems, particularly in combination with the ubiquitous bufferbloat for example in current broadband networks.
	In this paper, we analyse the issues of LEDBAT and propose a new approach for background traffic. Inspired by an astronomical event, we have named this approach Eclipse. Unlike LEDBAT, Eclipse can dynamically adapt to the network characteristics not only to minimise the additional network delay but also to maximise the utilisation of spare network capacity. We will show the usefulness of Eclipse by simulations.}",

With the increasing deployment of multipath transport protocols such as Multipath TCP (MPTCP) and the Concurrent Multipath Transfer extension of SCTP (CMT-SCTP), the term "fair" can have various interpretations. In this paper, inconsistencies are avoided by classifying fairness definitions according to the resource -bottleneck or network - and the participants - subflow, flow, tariff, etc. that share the resource. With example network scenarios the current (TCP-compatible) fairness view from both the single and multipath perspective is presented and their short-comings discussed. Alternative definitions are introduced and their benefits are illustrated based on a theoretical analysis. The realization aspects of the discussed fairness definitions are also presented. The evaluations of available coupled congestion control variants for multipath transport are shown to highlight the proximity of the simulated results to the theoretical target values. Due to the complexity of the realization of network-based approaches, bottleneck is chosen as the preferred resource. Tariff is a promising participant as it couples applications and incorporates economic entities for fair resource sharing at the transport layer.}",

different participants is known to be difficult but even the theoretical calculation of the resource capacity and its allocation is not a trivial task. Therefore in this work, resource allocation algorithms are presented to thoroughly evaluate the impact of the
fairness definitions. For a rigorous analysis, existing fairness definitions are identified according to the resources (bottleneck or network) and the competing participants (flow, tariff or user). Tariff as the participant, provides a realistic option to comply with the service level agreement between the operator and the user where as flow as the participant leads to TCP-compatible allocation. From the obtained results, it can be seen that if fairness is applied at the bottleneck then it is absolutely fair to the individual participants w.r.t. the bottleneck. On the other hand, fairness mechanisms considering the whole network as a single resource exploit the freedom of resource allocation (due to multipath flows) to achieve an overall similar allocation for the different participants (irrespective if the participant is composed of singlepath or multipath flows) but are still restricted by the topological constraints and might even result in a lower overall network throughput.}",

Using multiple end-to-end TCP connections as subflows, MPTCP distributes data to different subflows over multiple ISPs, so as to enhance network robustness and improve throughput.
This paper first presents MPTCP’s architecture and multi-path congestion control algorithm concepts. Then, it examines three test scenarios in the NorNet testbed, particularly highlighting the performance difference between using uncoupled and coupled congestion controls in multi-homed, real-world Internet setups. The results show that MPTCP with coupled CCs gets more benefits than TCP and demonstrates the lower aggressiveness in comparison to MPTCP with uncoupled CCs.}",

Its coupled congestion control intends to reap the increased bandwidth of multiple links, while avoiding to be more aggressive than regular TCP flows on every used link. We argue that this leads to a very conservative behavior when paths do not share a bottleneck. Therefore, in this paper, we first quantify the penalty of the coupled congestion control for the links that do not share a bottleneck. Then, in order to overcome this penalty, we design and implement a practical shared bottleneck detection (SBD) algorithm for MPTCP, namely MPTCP-SBD. Through extensive emulations, we show that MPTCP-SBD outperforms all currently deployed MPTCP coupled congestion controls by accurately detecting bottlenecks resulting in throughput gains of up to 30\% in the absence of shared bottlenecks while remaining fair to TCP in shared bottlenecks scenarios. We complement the emulation results with real-network experiments justifying it is safeness for deployment.}",

To ensure the validity of our evaluation, several experimental approaches were used including simulation, emulation and live experiments. When paths are symmetric in terms of capacity, delay and loss rate, we find that the experienced latency is significantly reduced, compared to using a single path. Using multiple asymmetric paths does not affect latency -- applications do not experience any increase or decrease, but might benefit from other advantages of multi-path communication. In the light of our conclusions, multi-path transport is suitable for latency-sensitive traffic and mature enough to be widely deployed.}",

This multi-homing property can be used for resilience, but there is also an increasing interest in making use of concurrent multi-path transport. That is, multiple network paths can be utilised simultaneously, in order to improve the payload throughput for applications like big data or cloud computing.
In this paper, we examine the performance of multi-path transport in real-world Internet setups, based on Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) in the NorNet testbed for multi-homed systems. However, systems in such challenging setups need proper configuration.

Of course, having multiple and possibly highly dissimilar paths for transmission is a challenge for the management of the send and receive buffers, since optimal throughput is desired with a reasonable allocation of the limited memory resources in MPTCP endpoints. This is particularly important when many MPTCP connections have to be handled simultaneously.
This paper measures out the required MPTCP buffer size in the real-world Internet testbed NorNet, comparing theoretical size and real size to analyse MPTCP performance. The experiment shows that multi-path transmission can effectively increase the application payload throughput, and greatly improve the robustness of the data transmission. As an important point of this paper, we can show that appropriate buffer size settings can increase the payload throughput, while not wasting resources.
This paper has certain significance for further accurately determining the optimal buffer size settings for multi-path transmission in large-scale Internet setups.}",

This presentation first introduces the basics of cloud computing: virtualisation, virtual machines, containers, and software as a service.
A challenge of using cloud computing is to deploy services to cloud providers, in order to operate them in a cost-efficient way while providing the best application experience to the users. The vision of the Multi-Cloud Execution-Ware for Large-scale Optimised Data-Intensive Computing~(MELODIC) project is to enable federated cloud computing for data-intensive applications. Furthermore, it provides the user with an easy-to-use, unified cloud environment, which hides the complexity of a multi-cloud. The second part of this presentation therefore provides an overview of the basic ideas and application use cases of MELODIC.}",

However, nowadays, applications are beginning to directly set the DSCP themselves, in the hope that this will yield a more appropriate service for their respective video, audio and data streams. WebRTC is a prime example of such an application.
As a first step towards understanding whether "WebRTC QoS works", we measured, for both IPv4 and IPv6, what happens to DSCP values along Internet paths. Our study is based on end-to-end measurements from 160 IPv4 and 65 IPv6 geographically spread controlled probe clients to 34 IPv4 and 18 IPv6 servers respectively. Clearly, when the DSCP value is changed, the net result may not be what the application desired. We find that this happens often, and conclude with recommendations on how to improve WebRTC and other applications using the DSCP.}",

With the increasing need for mobility and micro-services, particularly with the upcoming 5G mobile broadband networks, there is also a strong demand for mobile edge computing (MEC): applications run in small cloud systems in close proximity to the user, in order to minimize latencies. Both cloud and MEC have their advantages and disadvantages. Combining the two approaches in a unified multi-cloud, consisting of both traditional cloud services provisioned over heterogeneous cloud platforms and MEC systems, has the potential of obtaining the best out of both worlds. However, a comprehensive study is needed to evaluate the performance gains and the overheads involved for real-world cloud applications. In this paper, we introduce a baseline performance evaluation in order to identify the fallacies and pitfalls of combining multiple cloud systems and MEC into a unified MEC-multi-cloud platform. For this purpose, we analyze the basic, application-independent performance metrics of average round-trip time (RTT) and average application payload throughput in a setup consisting of two private and one public cloud systems. This baseline performance analysis confirms the feasibility of MEC-multi-cloud, and provides guidelines for designing an autonomic resource provisioning solutions, in terms of an extension proposed to our existing Melodic middleware platform for multi-cloud applications.}",

	abstract = "{A large fraction of the communication in the Internet is handled by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Since the first deployments of this protocol more than 30 years ago, the spectrum of applications as well as the structure of the network have developed at a fast pace. For example, today's network devices, like smartphones and laptops -- i.e.\ particularly many devices in the area of mobile computing -- frequently have an interesting property: the existence of multiple IP addresses (IPv4 and/or IPv6). The addresses may even change due to mobility. This property, denoted as multi-homing, can be utilised for multi-path transport, i.e. the simultaneous usage of multiple paths in the network to improve performance. Multi-path transport is a hot topic in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which is the standardisation organisation for the Internet.
This talk provides an overview of the work in the areas of multi-homing and multi-path transport, with focus on the area of the protocols TCP and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) with their experimental extensions Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) and Concurrent Multi-Path Transfer for SCTP (CMT-SCTP). It particularly shows the sequence of research and selected results, beginning from a simple simulation model, via lab setups and small Internet scenarios, up to the large-scale, international testbed project NorNet. NorNet, and particularly its landline network part NorNet Core, is furthermore described in some detail. Based on NorNet, it is finally possible to validate simulation results in real-world, multi-homed networks, in order to provide valuable input to the ongoing IETF standardisation processes of MPTCP and CMT-SCTP. Particularly, it will also show how the NorNet testbed can be utilised for research at Hainan University.}",

This presentation first introduces the basics of cloud computing: virtualisation, virtual machines, containers, and software as a service.
A challenge of using cloud computing is to deploy services to cloud providers, in order to operate them in a cost-efficient way while providing the best application experience to the users. The vision of the Multi-Cloud Execution-Ware for Large-scale Optimised Data-Intensive Computing~(MELODIC) project is to enable federated cloud computing for data-intensive applications. Furthermore, it provides the user with an easy-to-use, unified cloud environment, which hides the complexity of a multi-cloud.

However, nowadays, applications are beginning to directly set the DSCP themselves, in the hope that this will yield a more appropriate service for their respective video, audio and data streams. WebRTC is a prime example of such an application. We present measurements, for both IPv4 and IPv6, of what happens to DSCP values along Internet paths after an end system has set them without any prior agreement between a customer and a service provider. We find that the DSCP is often changed or zeroed along the path, but detrimental effects from using the DSCP are extremely rare; moreover, DSCP values sometimes remain intact (potentially having an effect on traffic) for several AS hops. This positive result motivates an analysis of the potential latency impact from such DSCP usage, for which we present the first measurement results. We find that routers at approximately 3% of more than 100,000 links differentiate between the WebRTC DSCP values (EF, AF42 and CS1) and consistently reduce delay in comparison with probes carrying a zero value (CS0) under congestion. In contrast, routers at around 2% of these links increase the delay by a comparable amount under congestion, uniformly for EF, AF42 and CS1.}",

The IETF Transport Services (TAPS) Working Group is standardizing a protocol-independent transport API and offering guidance to implementers. Apple’s recent “Network.framework” is specifically designed to allow such late and dynamic binding of protocols. When the network stack autonomously chooses and configures a protocol, it must first test which protocols are locally available and which work end-to-end (“protocol racing”). For this, it is important to know the set of available options, and which protocols should be tried first: Does it make sense to offer unchecked payload delivery, as with UDP-Lite? Is a UDP-based protocol like QUIC always a better choice, or should native SCTP be tried? This paper develops answers to such questions via (i) a NAT study in a local testbed, (ii) bidirectional Internet tests, (iii) a large scale Internet measurement campaign. The examined protocols are: SCTP, DCCP, UDP-Lite, UDP with a zero checksum and three different UDP encapsulations.}",

	abstract = "{Nowadays, we see a steadily increasing number of Internet devices with connections to multiple networks. For example, every smartphone provides mobile broadband and Wi-Fi connectivity. Multi-path transport protocols, like MPTCP, CMT-SCTP or Multipath-QUIC, allow for utilising all connected networks simultaneously. However, while there is a lot of research on the Transport Layer aspects of multi-path transport, there is not much work on the Network Layer perspective, yet.
In this paper, we introduce our Open Source tool HiPerConTracer (High-Performance Connectivity Tracer) for efficient, parallelised, long-term measurements of the path connectivity characteristics among multi-homed Internet systems. HiPerConTracer is now running as a permanent feature in the NorNet Core infrastructure, which is used for research on multi-homed systems, and in particular for research on multi-path transport. Based on the HiPerConTracer data collected in NorNet Core so far, we finally present some interesting results from the analysis of the inter-continental site connectivity between China and Norway in January 2020.

In this paper, we propose a new FullMesh algorithm based on Path Characteristic and Data Characteristic (PCDC), in which the Subflow Impact Factor (IF) is used as a subflow characteristic to predict the impact of the subflow on the overall throughput. Then, different path sets are adopted for different sizes of traffic. The PCDC algorithm is evaluated in the NorNet Core testbed, compared with the FullMesh algorithm. Our research results show that the PCDC algorithm can improve the network throughput, and reduce the overall completion time of small data streams.}",

	abstract = "{A large fraction of the communication in the Internet is handled by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Since the first deployments of this protocol more than 30 years ago, the spectrum of applications as well as the structure of the network have developed at a fast pace. For example, today's network devices, like smartphones and laptops -- i.e.\ particularly many devices in the area of mobile computing -- frequently have an interesting property: the existence of multiple IP addresses (IPv4 and/or IPv6). The addresses may even change due to mobility. This property, denoted as multi-homing, can be utilised for multi-path transport, i.e. the simultaneous usage of multiple paths in the network to improve performance. Multi-path transport is a hot topic in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which is the standardisation organisation for the Internet.
This talk provides an overview of the work in the areas of multi-homing and multi-path transport, with focus on the area of the protocols TCP and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) with their experimental extensions Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) and Concurrent Multi-Path Transfer for SCTP (CMT-SCTP). It particularly shows the sequence of research and selected results, beginning from a simple simulation model, via lab setups and small Internet scenarios, up to the large-scale, international testbed project NorNet. NorNet, and particularly its landline network part NorNet Core, is furthermore described in some detail. Based on NorNet, it is finally possible to validate simulation results in real-world, multi-homed networks, in order to provide valuable input to the ongoing IETF standardisation processes of MPTCP and CMT-SCTP. Particularly, it will also show how the NorNet testbed can be utilised for research at Hainan University in 2021.}",

First, we look at growth in video traffic during the pandemic, using traffic logs from a global video conferencing provider. Second, we leverage a country-wide deployment of measurement probes to assess the performance of mobile networks during the outbreak. We find that the lockdown has visibly impacted almost all aspects of Internet performance. Access networks have experienced an increase in peak and off-peak end to end latency.

Studies have shown that path management and packet scheduling have a large effect on overall performance and required limited resources with different congestion control parameters. Unfortunately, most of the previous studies have focused almost exclusively on the improvement of a single parameter, without a holistic view. To deal with this issue effectively, this paper puts forward a Multi-Parameter Comprehensive Optimized Algorithm (MPCOA), which can find the smaller buffer size and select the appropriate congestion control and path management algorithm on the premise of ensuring larger throughput. Experiments of three scenarios show that MPCOA can save the buffer space and subflow resources, and achieve high throughput. Meanwhile, a set of quantitative improvement results given by MPCOA is convenient for us to evaluate the quality of MPTCP network, and provide reference for our ongoing future work, like for 4G/5G, Internet of Things and Star Link networks.}",

The particular property of multi-homed systems is to be connected to multiple Internet Service Providers (ISP) simultaneously. Its initial purpose is of course to still provide connectivity in case of ISP/network failures. But does it really work that well, also with current protocols and applications? And redundancy does not come for free. A user connected to multiple ISPs will also receive multiple Internet bills each month. So, is there a possibility to make further use of multi-homing in the usual case where nothing goes wrong? Obviously, there are a lot of interesting research questions, which need to be examined in realistic Internet setups! Therefore, we are building up the NorNet open Internet testbed platform as a Linux- and Open-Source-software-based infrastructure, which currently spreads over multiple sites in different countries.
NorNet makes extensive use of advanced Linux features like Kernel-based Virtualisation (KVM), Linux Containers (LXC), BTRFS file system features, IP routing rules, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP), and many more. The goal of this talk is therefore to present an overview of the testbed, its underlying Linux features, and how they are combined to provide the multi-homing features to the various testbed users. This particularly includes an overview of how to make use of multi-path transport with MPTCP – based on the Linux MPTCP implementation – in multi-homed environments. The idea is to provide guidelines for also utilising multi-homing features in own projects.}",

Mobile (computing) devices are becoming increasingly ubiquitous to our computing domain, but with limited resources (true both for computation as well as for energy). Hence, workload offloading from resource-constrained mobile devices to the edge and maybe later to the cloud become necessary as well as useful. Thanks to the persistent technical breakthroughs in global wireless standards (or in mobile networks), together with the almost limitless amount of resources in public cloud platforms, workload offloading is possible and cheaper. In such scenarios, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) resources could be provisioned in proximity to the users for supporting latency-sensitive applications. Here, two relevant problems could be:
i) How to distribute workload to the resource pools of MEC as well as public (multi-)clouds?
ii) How to manage such resource pools effectively?
To answer these problems in this paper, we examine the performance of our proposed approach using the Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) framework in more detail. We also have outlined the resource pool management policies to effectively use RSerPool for workload offloading from mobile devices into the cloud/MEC ecosystem.

With the intuition that every device on the data path contributes to the end-to-end delay, we propose a simple and deterministic measurement-based approach for detecting the insertion of a layer-2 switch on the data path of a network operator. For this purpose, we use commodity hardware and the standard ping tool for collecting ICMP RTTs. To minimise inaccuracies in the measurements, we increase timing determinism on both ICMP source and target by using a real-time kernel on both, a dedicated source (a Linux server) and target (an RPI4 with custom image). Additionally, we manipulate real-time attributes for prioritising the ping process. By using this approach on different loaded networks: lab, campus network, research and education network and an ISP, we are able to reliably detect that a switch was added at the end of the path or within it. Our method yields an excellent performance on networks with considerable cross traffic as well as lightly loaded networks.}",

However, the high growth in size and complexity of current operational networks (2022) demands new solutions to process huge amounts of data (including alarms) reliably and swiftly. Further, as the network becomes progressively more virtualized, the hosting of nfv on cloud environments adds a magnitude of possible bottlenecks outside the control of the service owners. In this paper, we propose two deep learning anomaly detection solutions that leverage service exposure and apply it to automate the detection of service degradation and root cause discovery in a cloudified mobile network that is orchestrated by ETSI OSM. A testbed is built to validate these AI models. The testbed collects monitoring data from the OSM monitoring module, which is then exposed to the external AI anomaly detection modules, tuned to identify the anomalies and the network services causing them. The deep learning solutions are tested using various artificially induced bottlenecks. The AI solutions are shown to correctly detect anomalies and identify the network components involved in the bottlenecks, with certain limitations in a particular type of bottlenecks. A discussion of the right monitoring tools to identify concrete bottlenecks is provided.}",

Our framework adds a data protection layer over the content distribution network, using blockchain and relying on the fog to distribute the contents with low latency. Our framework is different from the existing works in multiple aspects, such as i) data are primarily distributed from the fog nodes, ii) blockchain is used to protect data and iii) blockchain allows statistical and other information sharing among stakeholders (such as content creators) following access rights. Sharing statistics about content distribution activity can bring transparency and trustworthiness among the stakeholders, including the subscribers, into the ICN platforms.

	abstract = "{Mobile devices are becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives, but they have limited computational capacity. Thanks to the advancement in the network infrastructure, task offloading from resource-constrained devices to the near edge and the cloud becomes possible and advantageous. Complete task offloading is now possible to almost limitless computing resources of public cloud platforms. Generally, the edge computing resources support latency-sensitive applications with limited computing resources, while the cloud supports latency-tolerant applications. This paper proposes one lightweight task-scheduling framework from cloud service provider perspective, for applications using both cloud and edge platforms. Here, the challenge is using edge and cloud resources efficiently when necessary. Such decisions have to be made quickly, with a small management overhead. Our framework aims at solving two research questions. They are: i) How to distribute tasks to the edge resource pools and multi-clouds? ii) How to manage these resource pools effectively with low overheads? To answer these two questions, we examine the performance of our proposed framework based on Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool). We have shown via simulations that RSerPool, with the correct usage and configuration of pool member selection policies, can accomplish the cloud/edge setup resource selection task with a small overhead.}"

To make them deployable and executable in production, they need to be assigned to heterogeneous resources in computing continuum’s, consisting of multiple clouds, devices and other runtime platforms. Existing assignment processes are neither transparent nor interactive. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Continuum Deployer, a tool capable of reading application descriptions (e.g. Helm charts for Kubernetes), interactively performing and comparing assignment algorithms (e.g. to multiple K8s and K3s cloud/edge/fog/device resources), and exporting deployment files (e.g. Kubernetes manifests). We evaluate the tool with empirical package analysis, exemplary deployments and a synthetic experiment to appropriately address scalability concerns.}"

In this paper, we introduce MEDAL—an intelli- gent Cloud-to-Edge Data Fabric to support Data Operations (DataOps) across the continuum and to automate management and orchestration operations over a combined view of the data and the resource layer. MEDAL facilitates building and managing data workflows on top of existing flexible and composable data services, seamlessly exploiting and federating IaaS/PaaS/SaaS resources across different Cloud and Edge environments. We describe the MEDAL Platform as a usable tool for Data Scientists and Engineers, encompassing our concept and we illustrate its application though a connected cars use case.}"

Container technology allows for a more lightweight execution, in com- parison with popular Virtual Machines. Efficient scheduling of containers is still challenging due to varying request arrival patterns, application-specific resource consumption and resource heterogeneity in physical servers. Besides, containers are also more prone to resource contention and performance interference. Cloud providers need to overcome these challenges with a goal in mind: maximize resource utilization to satisfy as many requests as possible. This paper introduces RLSched, a deep reinforcement learning-based (DRL) scheduler that is self-adaptive and automatically captures the resource usage dynamics in the data center. The scheduler is based on a decentralized actor-critic multi-agent architecture that enables for parallel execution and faster convergence. RLSched relies on an enhanced network model with action shaping, which filters invalid actions and prevents the agent to fall into a sub-optimal policy. The proposed scheduler is compared against other state-of-the-art DRL methods on a simulated data center environment based on real traces from Microsoft Azure. The results show faster convergence and higher number of containers placed per session.}"

	abstract = "{With the widespread availability of multi-homed devices, multipath transport protocols such as MPTCP are becoming increasingly relevant to support better use of multiple connectivity through capacity aggregation and seamless failover. However, capacity aggregation over heterogeneous paths, such as offered by cellular and Wi-Fi networks, is problematic. It causes packet reordering leading to head-of-line (HoL) blocking at the receiver, increased end-to-end delays and lower application goodput. MPTCP tackles this issue by penalising the use of longer paths, and increasing buffer sizes. This, however, results in suboptimal resource usage. In this paper, we first evaluate and compare the performance of default MPTCP and alternative state-of-the-art schedulers, all implemented in the Linux kernel, for a range of traffic patterns and network environments. This allows us to identify shortcomings of various approaches. We then propose a send-window BLocking ESTimation scheduler, BLEST, which aims to minimise HoL-blocking in heterogeneous networks, thereby increasing the potential for capacity aggregation by reducing the number of spurious retransmissions. The resulting scheduler allows an increase by 12% in application goodput with bulk traffic while reducing unnecessary retransmissions by 80% as compared to default MPTCP and other schedulers.}",

The uptake has however been rather slow. Some operating systems support MPTCP out of the box, but little is known about their deployment on the server side. We built a scanning infrastructure to search for MPTCP-capable hosts on the Internet. In this study, we used the top-1M Alexa servers to test the platform and gain insight about server support. We find that less than 0.1% of Alexa unique domains and IP addresses currently support MPTCP. Their geographic distribution is quite different from that of clients reported in other studies, with the majority of domains being in China. We also find that very few IPs actually expose multi-homing information, suggesting that these early deployments aim at providing reliability rather than capacity aggregation. We also identify some deployment issues.}",

End-to-end downtime statistics were collected during two 3-month periods, mid November 2009 till mid February 2010 and July 2010 till September 2010. Probe packets were sent every 10 ms between the two measurement systems supplemented by traceroute measurements every two minutes. The collected data (TTL, timestamps, sequence numbers and traceroute output) enabled identification and characterization of IP-level paths between the end-points. Causes of observed network failures were identified and insight is gained into processes preceding and following communication downtimes. We distinguish inter- and intradomain failures and, when possible, identify an exact link or an Autonomous System where a certain event has happened. The study shows that the end-to-end path availability is mainly affected by interdomain failures and long BGP convergence time as well as series of events not straight forwardly explained by the anticipated (re)routing behavior.}",

	abstract = "{The management of a complex cyber-physical system such as the Smart Grid (SG) requires responsive, scalable and high-bandwidth communication, which is often beyond the capabilities of the classical closed communication networks of the power grid. Consequently, the use of scalable public IP based networks is increasingly being advocated. However, a direct consequence of the use of public networks is the exposure of the SG to varied reliability/security risks, e.g., distributed denial of service (DDoS). Thus the need exists for new lightweight mechanisms that can provide both cost-effective communication along with proactive DDoS attack protection. We fill this gap by proposing a novel approach termed as SeReCP, which leverages: (1) a semi-trusted P2P-based publish-subscribe (pub-sub) system providing a proactive countermeasure for DDoS attacks and secure group communications by aid of a group key management system, (2) a data diffusion mechanism that sustains the network availability in the case of both randomly sweeping and targeted DDoS attacks on pub-sub brokers, and (3) a multi-homing-based fast recovery mechanism for detecting and requesting the dropped packets, thus paving the way for meeting the stringent latency requirements of SG applications. Our evaluation on a real testbed demonstrates that SeReCP provides the required security and availability for SG applications with up to 30% failures of the pub-sub brokers. Overall, we show that SeReCP helps enable the secure use of public network based communication for safetycritical cyber-physical systems such as the SG.}",

Since more than one subflow is used, an efficient multipath scheduling algorithm is needed at the sender. The objective of the scheduler is to identify the subflow over which the current data packet should be sent. This paper compares the most important types of schedulers for multipath transfers. We model their performance analytically and derive key metrics, most notably the resulting end-to-end delay over heterogeneous paths. Our results show that a scheduler minimizing the packet delivery delay yields the best overall performance, but it is complex to realize. An alternative scheduler based on the sender queue size is simpler and has sufficient performance for relatively small asymmetry between the multiple paths. Our model results are confirmed by measurements with a real multipath transport protocol.}",

This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the use of MPTCP to reduce latency and thus improve the quality of experience or QoE for cloud-based applications. In particular, the paper considers the possible reductions in latency that could be obtained by using MPTCP and multiple network paths between a cloud service and a mobile end user. To obtain an appreciation of the expected latency performance for different types of cloud traffic, three applications are studied, Netflix, Google Maps, and Google Docs, representing typical applications generating high-, mid-, and low-intensity traffic. The results suggest that MPTCP could provide significant latency reductions for cloud applications, especially for applications such as Netflix and Google Maps. Moreover, the results suggest that MPTCP offers a reduced latency despite a few percent packet loss, and in spite of limited differences in the round-trip times of the network paths in an MPTCP connection. Still, larger differences in the round-trip times seem to significantly increase the application latency, especially for Netflix, Google Maps, and similar applications. Thus, to become an even better alternative to these applications, this paper suggests that the MPTCP packet scheduling policy should be changed: Apart from the round-trip times of the network paths in a connection, it should also consider the difference in round-trip time between the network paths.}",

In order to effectively protect VoIP users from misuse, researchers use, e.g., honeynets to capture and analyze VoIP attacks occurring in the Internet. Global VoIP security threats are analyzed by studying several millions of real-world attacks collected in independent VoIP honeynet solutions with different capture mechanisms over a long period of time. Due to the validation of results from several honeynet designs we have achieved a unique, much broader view on large scale attacks. The results show similar attacker behavior, confirm previous assumptions about attacks and present new insights in large scale VoIP attacks, e.g., for toll fraud.}",

Such performance degradation in turn can adversely impact the user experience. In this paper, we study packet loss characteristics of MBB networks under mobility using six measurement nodes that are placed on regional and inter-city trains in Norway for a period of seven months. Our findings show that packet loss is significantly higher for mobility scenarios compared to the stationary. In order to understand the cause of packet loss, we investigate Radio Access Technology (RAT) changes, temporary loss of service, and changes in cells and location area codes (LAC). We surprisingly find that almost all periods with RAT changes involve packet loss. We also observe that 70% of the overall loss happens in periods with RAT changes or temporary loss of service. Further, one third of RAT changes involve connection termination. Our findings highlight the importance of radio access network (RAN) planning and configuration, and provide guidelines to alleviate packet loss in MBB networks.}",

In general, we find high variation in delay within the same radio access type and RRC state. Across both networks we study, we observe connections with round trip delays of several seconds, often multiple times per hour, that are more frequent when nodes are moving. Correlating these extreme delay events with available metadata, we find they are related to handovers, radio state transitions, and retransmissions at the link and physical layers.}",

	abstract = "{Mobile broadband networks play an increasingly important role in society, and there is a strong need for independent assessments of their robustness and performance. A promising source of such information is active end-to-end measurements. It is, however, a challenging task to go from individual measurements to an assessment of network reliability, which is a complex notion encompassing many stability and performance related metrics. This paper presents a framework for measuring the user-experienced reliability in mobile broadband networks. We argue that reliability must be assessed at several levels, from the availability of the network connection to the stability of application performance. Based on the proposed framework, we conduct a large-scale measurement study of reliability in 5 mobile broadband networks. The study builds on active measurements from hundreds of measurement nodes over a period of 10 months. The results show that the reliability of mobile broadband networks is lower than one could hope: more than 20% of connections from stationary nodes are unavailable more than 10 minutes per day. There is, however, a significant potential for improving robustness if a device can connect simultaneously to several networks. We find that in most cases, our devices can achieve 99.999% ("five nines") connection availability by combining two operators. We further show how both radio conditions and network configuration play important roles in determining reliability, and how external measurements can reveal weaknesses and incidents that are not always captured by the operators existing monitoring tools.}",

We find that the IPv6 network is maturing, albeit slowly. While most core Internet transit providers have deployed IPv6, edge networks are lagging. Early IPv6 network deployment was stronger in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, than in North America. Current IPv6 network deployment still shows the same pattern. The IPv6 topology is characterized by a single dominant player -- Hurricane Electric -- which appears in a large fraction of IPv6 AS paths, and is more dominant in IPv6 than the most dominant player in IPv4. Routing dynamics in the IPv6 topology are largely similar to those in IPv4, and churn in both networks grows at the same rate as the underlying topologies. Our measurements suggest that performance over IPv6 paths is comparable to that over IPv4 paths if the AS-level paths are the same, but can be much worse than IPv4 if the AS-level paths differ.}",

	abstract = "{In February 2011 the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority~(IANA) exhausted its free pool of IPv4 addresses, and the regional registries (RIRs) have started to run out of IPv4 addresses as well. As RIRs have started rationing allocations, IPv4 transfer markets have emerged as a new mechanism to acquire IPv4 addresses. Barring a few high-profile exceptions, IPv4 transfers have largely flown under the radar. In this work, we use the lists of transfers published by three RIRs to characterize the transfer market - the types of players involved, the sizes and characteristics of transferred address blocks, and visible effects on the routing table. Next, we take first steps toward detecting address transfers using BGP data from the Routeviews and RIPE repositories from 2004-2013. We identify reasons why legitimate changes in prefix origin could be confused as transfers, and implement a series of 10 filters that remove 86% of candidate transfers. We find the remaining number of inferred transfers is increasing over time. We could confirm few (0.16%) of these transfers using RIR-published transfer lists, while our inference methodology undoubtedly yields false positives, a black market for IPv4 transfers may exist as well.}",

We first design and implement a generic modular scheduler framework that enables testing of different schedulers for Multipath TCP. We then use this framework to do an in-depth analysis of different schedulers by running experiments on a emulator and a testbed. We consider bulk data transfer as well as application limited traffic and identify metrics to quantify the scheduler's performance. Our results shed light on how scheduling decisions can help to improve multipath transfer.}",

	abstract = "{Driven by the visions of Internet of Things and 5G communications, recent years have seen a paradigm shift in mobile computing, from the centralized mobile cloud computing toward mobile edge computing (MEC). The main feature of MEC is to push mobile computing, network control and storage to the network edges (e.g., base stations and access points) so as to enable computation-intensive and latency-critical applications at the resource-limited mobile devices. MEC promises dramatic reduction in latency and mobile energy consumption, tackling the key challenges for materializing 5G vision. The promised gains of MEC have motivated extensive efforts in both academia and industry on developing the technology. A main thrust of MEC research is to seamlessly merge the two disciplines of wireless communications and mobile computing, resulting in a wide-range of new designs ranging from techniques for computation offloading to network architectures. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art MEC research with a focus on joint radio-and-computational resource management. We also discuss a set of issues, challenges, and future research directions for MEC research, including MEC system deployment, cache-enabled MEC, mobility management for MEC, green MEC, as well as privacy-aware MEC. Advancements in these directions will facilitate the transformation of MEC from theory to practice. Finally, we introduce recent standardization efforts on MEC as well as some typical MEC application scenarios.}",

The research papers covered are classified into four categories: NFV Infrastructure (NFVI), Network Functions (NFs), Management And Network Orchestration (MANO), and service chaining. The NFVI papers describe "framework" software that implement common functions, such as dynamic scaling and load balancing, required by NF developers. Papers on NFs are classified as offering solutions for software switches or middleboxes. MANO papers covered in this survey are primarily on resource allocation (virtual network embedding), which is an orchestrator function. Finally, service chaining papers that offer examples and extensions are reviewed. Our conclusions are that with the current level of investment in NFV from cloud and Internet service providers, the promised cost savings are likely to be realized, though many challenges remain.}",

	abstract = "{In heterogeneous networks, TCP connections that incorporate a terrestrial or satellite radio link are greatly disadvantaged with respect to entirely wired connections, because of their longer round trip times RTTs. To cope with this problem, a new TCP proposal, the TCP Hybla, is presented and discussed in the paper. It stems from an analytical evaluation of the congestion window dynamics in the TCP standard versions Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, which suggests the necessary modifications to remove the performance dependence on RTT. TCP Hybla performance is firstly evaluated in the case of an ideal channel, with good correlation between analytical and simulation data. Then, more realistic situations, which require the adoption of a benchmark network topology and a careful ns-2 simulation set-up, are examined. In particular, TCP Hybla performance is compared with that achievable by TCP standard in the presence of congestion and link losses, either separately or jointly considered. In all the examined cases, the superiority of TCP Hybla is evident, as it greatly reduces the severe penalization suffered by wireless, and especially satellite, TCP connections. Finally, it is worth noting that TCP Hybla does not infringe the end to end semantics of TCP and is compatible with other promising enhancements.}",

NorNet Edge consists of a large number of dedicated hardware nodes connected to all mobile broadband providers in Norway. The nodes are based on cheap commodity hardware and run a full Linux-distribution, allowing full flexibility in designing and performing measurements. Custom-made software in the nodes automatically detects and configures the network subsystem based on available networks, making them especially well suited for mobile broadband measurements. The software is based on commonly available functionality and is easy to port to different hardware architectures or operating systems. In this paper, we present the architecture and functional goals of NorNet Edge, evaluate important performance aspects of the hardware nodes, and present results from an illustrative measurement experiment.}",

	abstract = "{TCP congestion control can perform badly in highspeed wide area networks because of its slow response with large congestion windows. The challenge for any alternative protocol is to better utilize networks with high bandwidth-delay products in a simple and robust manner without interacting badly with existing traffic. Scalable TCP is a simple sender-side alteration to the TCP congestion window update algorithm. It offers a robust mechanism to improve performance in highspeed wide area networks using traditional TCP receivers. Scalable TCP is designed to be incrementally deployable and behaves identically to traditional TCP stacks when small windows are sufficient. The performance of the scheme is evaluated through experimental results gathered using a Scalable TCP implementation for the Linux operating system and a gigabit transatlantic network. The preliminary results gathered suggest that the deployment of Scalable TCP would have negligible impact on existing network traffic at the same time as improving bulk transfer performance in highspeed wide area networks.}",

ASAP uses a handle-based addressing model that isolates a logical communication endpoint from its IP address(es), thus effectively eliminating the binding between the communication endpoint and its physical IP address(es), which normally constitutes a single point of failure.
 In addition, ASAP defines each logical communication destination as a pool, providing full transparent support for server pooling and load sharing. It also allows dynamic system scalability -- members of a server pool can be added or removed at any time without interrupting the service.
 ASAP is designed to take full advantage of the network level redundancy provided by the Stream Transmission Control Protocol~(SCTP, RFC 4960). Each transport protocol, other than SCTP, MUST have an accompanying transport mapping document. It should be noted that ASAP messages passed between Pool Elements~(PEs) and ENRP servers MUST use the SCTP transport protocol.
 The high-availability server pooling is gained by combining two protocols, namely ASAP and ENRP, in which ASAP provides the user interface for Pool Handle to address translation, load sharing management, and fault management, while ENRP defines the high- availability Pool Handle translation service. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.}",

For that reason the Multipath TCP has the same limitations as the plain TCP during connection setup, in case the selected path is not functional. This document proposes a set of implementations and possible combinations thereof, that provide a more Robust Establishment~(RobE) of MPTCP sessions. It includes RobE_TIMER, RobE_SIM, RobE_eSIM and RobE_IPS. RobE_TIMER is designed to stay close to MPTCP in that standard functionality is used wherever possible. Resiliency against network outages is achieved by modifying the SYN retransmission timer: If one path is defective, another path is used. RobE_SIM and RobE_eSIM provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths for connection setup. They ensure connectivity if at least one functional path out of a bunch of paths is given and offers beside that the opportunity to significantly improve loading times of Internet services. RobE_IPS provides a heuristic to select properly an initial path for connection establishment with a remote host based on empirical data derived from previous connection information. In practice, these independent solutions can be complementary used. This document also presents the design and protocol procedure for those combinations in addition to the respective stand-alone solutions.}",

On decapsulation, it updates both RFC~3168 and RFC~4301 to add new behaviours for previously unused combinations of inner and outer headers. The new rules ensure the ECN field is correctly propagated across a tunnel whether it is used to signal one or two severity levels of congestion; whereas before, only one severity level was supported. Tunnel endpoints can be updated in any order without affecting pre-existing uses of the ECN field, thus ensuring backward compatibility. Nonetheless, operators wanting to support two severity levels~(e.g., for pre-congestion notification -- PCN) can require compliance with this new specification.

Thank- you! In summary, we have four independent implementations of all the MPTCP signalling messages, with the exception of address management, and some interoperabiity testing has been done by the other three implementations with the 'reference' Linux implementation. So it appears that the RFC is~(at least largely) clear and correct. On address management, we have only one implementation of ADD_ADDR with two teams choosing not to implement it. We have one implementation of the working group's coupled congestion control~(RFC6356) and none of the MPTCP-aware API~(RFC6897). The main suggested improvements are around o how MPTCP falls back~(if the signalling is interrupted by a middlebox):~(1) corner cases that are not handled properly,~(2) at the IETF, the MPTCP community should work with middlebox vendors, either to reduce or eliminate the need for fallback or to understand the middlebox interactions better. o security: both better MPTCP security~(perhaps building on SSL) and a lighter weight mechanism, preferably both in one mechanism.

Resource usage within the network would be more efficient were it possible for these multiple paths to be used concurrently. Multipath TCP is a proposal to achieve multipath transport in TCP. New congestion control algorithms are needed for multipath transport protocols such as Multipath TCP, as single path algorithms have a series of issues in the multipath context. One of the prominent problems is that running existing algorithms such as TCP New Reno independently on each path would give the multipath flow more than its fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of its subflows. Further, it is desirable that a source with multiple paths available will transfer more traffic using the least congested of the paths, hence achieving resource pooling. This would increase the overall utilization of the network and also its robustness to failure. This document presents a congestion control algorithm which couples the congestion control algorithms running on different subflows by linking their increase functions, and dynamically controls the overall aggresiveness of the multipath flow. The result is a practical algorithm that is fair to TCP at bottlenecks while moving traffic away from congested links.}",

	abstract = "{This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol. RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services. RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services. The data transport is augmented by a control protocol~(RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality. RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers. The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers. Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC~1889 which it obsoletes. There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used. The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.}",

In particular, we note that alternative experimental proposals are likely to be forthcoming, and it is not well understood how the proposals in this document will interact with such alternative proposals. This document proposes HighSpeed TCP, a modification to TCP's congestion control mechanism for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows. The congestion control mechanisms of the current Standard TCP constrains the congestion windows that can be achieved by TCP in realistic environments. For example, for a Standard TCP connection with 1500-byte packets and a 100 ms round-trip time, achieving a steady-state throughput of 10 Gbps would require an average congestion window of 83,333 segments, and a packet drop rate of at most one congestion event every 5,000,000,000 packets~(or equivalently, at most one congestion event every 1 2/3 hours). This is widely acknowledged as an unrealistic constraint. To address his limitation of TCP, this document proposes HighSpeed TCP, and solicits experimentation and feedback from the wider community.}",

By definition, data that has been delivered to the application is non-renegable by the SCTP data receiver.~(Recall that, in SCTP, out- of-order data can sometimes be delivered.) Also, SCTP implementations can be configured such that the SCTP data receiver is not allowed to, and therefore, never reneges on out-of-order data.

NR-SACKs enable a data receiver to explicitly inform the data sender of non-renegable out-of-order data.

ASAP uses a handle-based addressing model that isolates a logical communication endpoint from its IP address(es), thus effectively eliminating the binding between the communication endpoint and its physical IP address(es), which normally constitutes a single point of failure. In addition, ASAP defines each logical communication destination as a pool, providing full transparent support for server pooling and load sharing. It also allows dynamic system scalability -- members of a server pool can be added or removed at any time without interrupting the service. ASAP is designed to take full advantage of the network level redundancy provided by the Stream Transmission Control Protocol~(SCTP; RFC~4960). Each transport protocol, other than SCTP, MUST have an accompanying transport mapping document. It should be noted that ASAP messages passed between Pool Elements~(PEs) and ENRP servers MUST use the SCTP transport protocol. The high-availability server pooling is gained by combining two protocols, namely ASAP and ENRP, in which ASAP provides the user interface for Pool Handle to address translation, load sharing management, and fault management, while ENRP defines the high- availability Pool Handle translation service.

Resource usage within the network would be more efficient were it possible for these multiple paths to be used concurrently. Multipath TCP is a proposal to achieve multipath transport in TCP. New congestion control algorithms are needed for multipath transport protocols such as Multipath TCP, as single path algorithms have a series of issues in the multipath context. One of the prominent problems is that running existing algorithms such as standard TCP independently on each path would give the multipath flow more than its fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of its subflows. Further, it is desirable that a source with multiple paths available will transfer more traffic using the least congested of the paths, achieving a property called "resource pooling" where a bundle of links effectively behaves like one shared link with bigger capacity. This would increase the overall efficiency of the network and also its robustness to failure. This document presents a congestion control algorithm that couples the congestion control algorithms running on different subflows by linking their increase functions, and dynamically controls the overall aggressiveness of the multipath flow. The result is a practical algorithm that is fair to TCP at bottlenecks while moving traffic away from congested links. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.}",

The abstract API described here is based on the final analysis and design work done in Work Package 1 of the NEAT Project. This fulfils the requirements of the NEAT use cases, outlined in Deliverable D1.1. The API has evolved and been streamlined following implementation experience from WP2. Some original primitives and events identified in Deliverable D1.2 have been changed or removed; most importantly perhaps, it was determined to be more suitable to implement some functions in the form of a policy rather than as a function call.

However, as we will show in this paper, IP options are not well supported in the Internet. We make use of the PlanetLab planetary scale network testbed to quantify the fate of IP-option enabled packets in the wide-area. We measured wide-area paths with both standard IP packets and packets with options. We discovered that approximately half of Internet paths drop packets with options, raising serious dependability issues. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that it is feasible to restore support for options in the wide-area. We discovered that the core of the network drops very few options packets, with the vast majority of those drops occurring in edge AS networks. Furthermore, these drops are concentrated in a minority of the ASes.}",

Specifically, cloud computing popularized migration of computing functions~(e.g., applications) and storage from local, dedicated, physical resources to remote virtual functions accessible through the Internet. In a similar manner, network virtualization is encouraging migration of networking functions from dedicated physical hardware nodes to a virtualized pool of resources. However, network virtualization can be considered to be a more complex problem than cloud computing as it not only involves virtualization of computing and storage functions but also involves abstraction of the network itself. This document describes current research and engineering challenges in network virtualization including the guarantee of quality of service, performance improvement, support for multiple domains, network slicing, service composition, device virtualization, privacy and security, separation of control concerns, network function placement, and testing. In addition, some proposals are made for new activities in the IETF and IRTF that could address some of these challenges.

	abstract = "{Highly flexible software network functions (NFs) are crucial components to enable multi-tenancy in the clouds. However, software packet processing on a commodity server has
limited capacity and induces high latency. While software NFs could scale out using more servers, doing so adds significant cost. This paper focuses on accelerating NFs with programmable hardware, i.e., FPGA, which is now a mature technology and inexpensive for datacenters. However, FPGA is predominately programmed using low-level hardware description languages (HDLs), which are hard to code and difficult to debug. More importantly, HDLs are almost inaccessible for most software programmers. This paper presents ClickNP, a FPGA-accelerated platform for highly flexible and high-performance NFs with commodity servers. ClickNP is highly flexible as it is completely programmable using high-level C-like languages, and exposes a modular programming abstraction that resembles Click Modular Router.
ClickNP is also high performance. Our prototype NFs show that they can process traffic at up to 200 million packets per second with ultra-low latency (&lt; 2us). Compared to existing software
counterparts, with FPGA, ClickNP improves throughput by 10x, while reducing latency by 10x. To the best of our knowledge, ClickNP is the first FPGA-accelerated platform for NFs, written completely in high-level language and achieving 40 Gbps line rate at any packet size.}",

	abstract = "{The Stream Control Transmission Protocol~(SCTP) as defined in RFC~4960 is an advanced Transport Layer protocol that provides support for multi-homing. That is, SCTP endpoints may simultaneously use multiple Network Layer addresses, which allows to connect the endpoints to multiple networks for redundancy purposes. However, for the transfer of user data, only one of the possible paths is currently used at a time. All other paths remain as backup and are only used for retransmissions.
Clearly, the existence of multiple paths has led to the idea of applying load sharing among the paths. An extension to SCTP -- denoted as Concurrent Multipath Transfer~(CMT) -- realises this load sharing functionality. While this approach works well for similar paths, i.e.\ paths having similar characteristics regarding bandwidths, bit error rates and delays, the use of dissimilar paths does not work that neatly.
In this thesis, the issues of dissimilar paths for CMT-based load sharing will be demonstrated first. The reasons for these issues will be identified and solutions proposed. These solutions will be evaluated in simulations, as well as partially also in a real-world Internet testbed setup, in order to show their effectiveness. In particular, it will be shown that a combination of multiple mechanisms is necessary to make CMT work as expected under a wide range of network and system parameters.
Furthermore, the fairness of CMT-based transport -- in concurrency to classic non-CMT flows -- will be analysed. The usage of plain CMT leads to an overly aggressive bandwidth occupation on so-called shared bottlenecks. As a countermeasure, the idea of Resource Pooling will be utilised. For this purpose, two new and one adapted congestion control approach -- all based on the Resource Pooling principle -- will be introduced and examined in similar as well as dissimilar path setups, in order to show how to fairly deploy CMT transport in the Internet.
The results of this work have also been contributed to the ongoing IETF~standardisation process of SCTP and its extensions.}",

Dienste werden mittels eines geschichteten, hierarchischen Protokollstacks realisiert, bei welchem eine Interaktion nicht-benachbarter Schichten nicht vorgesehen ist. Dieser starre Aufbau macht bereits das Anpassen der Internet-Architektur an die Anforderungen der heutigen Anwendungen – wie etwa File Sharing, Videotelefonie und mobile Endgeräte – kompliziert. Die großen Herausforderungen des zukünftigen Internets – welches als das Future Internet bezeichnet wird – mit Anwendungsszenarien wie Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Sensornetzwerken und vielen weiteren – erfordern jedoch noch weitaus umfangreichere Anpassungen. Zudem ist eine große Flexibilität erforderlich, um auch weiteren – heute noch nicht absehbaren – Anforderungen gerecht zu werden.
Im Rahmen dieses Habilitationsvortrages wird zunächst kurz auf die Probleme des aktuellen Internets eingegangen sowie die Herausforderungen des Future Internets vorgestellt. Im Anschluss daran wird eine Auswahl der für den Übergang zum Future Internet möglichen evolutionären sowie revolutionären Ansätze vorgestellt. Der Schwerpunkt liegt hierbei auf den noch relativ neuen – und in der Forschung momentan sehr aktiv diskutierten – revolutionären Ansätzen, welche mit der Idee des sogenannten Clean Slate einen vollständigen Neuansatz anstreben. Hierbei werden die Ansätze der Funktionalen Komposition, des Content-Centric Networking sowie der Virtualisierung von Netzwerken vorgestellt. Zum Schluss wird dann auf die Frage eingegangen, wie eine Nutzung der vorgestellten Ansätze in der Praxis möglich ist und welche der aktuell in Diskussion befindlichen Ansätze sich in Zukunft voraussichtlich durchsetzen werden.}",

These functionalities as such are not new, but their combination into one generic, application-independent framework is.
Initial goal of this thesis is to gain insight into the complex RSerPool mechanisms by performing experimental and simulative proof-of-concept tests. The further goals are to systematically validate the RSerPool architecture and its protocols, provide improvements and optimizations where necessary and propose extensions if useful. Based on these evaluations, recommendations to implementers and users of RSerPool should be provided, giving guidelines for the tuning of system parameters and the appropriate configuration of application scenarios. In particular, it is also a goal to transfer insights, optimizations and extensions of the RSerPool protocols from simulation to reality and also to bring the achievements from research into application by supporting and contributing relevant results to the IETF's ongoing RSerPool standardization process.
To achieve the described goals, a prototype implementation as well as a simulation model are designed and realized at first. Using a generic application model and appropriate performance metrics, the performance of RSerPool systems in failure-free and server failure scenarios is systematically evaluated in order to identify critical parameter ranges and problematic protocol behaviour. Improvements developed as result of these performance analyses are evaluated and finally contributed into the standardization process of RSerPool.}",

	abstract = "{The Internet is developing with a very high speed. Just a few years ago, its main applications were file transfer and e-mail access, all based on the best effort TCP/IP service over quite slow links. With the quickly growing deployment of high-speed Internet accesses, there is a growing demand for also using the Internet in application scenarios like real-time multimedia streaming, particularly for audio and video on demand services. However, such multimedia applications do not only require sufficient bandwidth. They have stricter quality of service demands, like e.g.\ an upper bound on the transfer delay to ensure interactivity for their users.
In the context of this thesis, a system for the cost-efficient transfer of variable bitrate multimedia streams over Differentiated Services~(DiffServ) is presented and evaluated. This system supports layered transmission, i.e.\ streams may be partitioned into sub-streams denoted as layers (e.g.\ a video layer and an audio layer). Distinct layers may have different priorities as well as quality of service requirements and may therefore use different DiffServ classes for data transmission. Also, the streams may be scalable, i.e.\ the quality of the transferred media may be decreased in order to reduce the bandwidth requirements when bandwidth becomes scarce. Particularly, the system makes use of the fact that media files in e.g.\ a video on demand library can be analyzed a priorily. The information that is computed during the offline analysis is used to realize a dynamic and cost-efficient transport of layer data over different DiffServ classes. Furthermore, the system applies an adaptive buffering to smooth the flows -- in order to save bandwidth -- while also taking care of the delay constraints.}",

	abstract = "{Load sharing on the transport layer of the OSI reference model is an important topic in the IETF standardization. This approach is also supported by the industry to optimize the use of the resources in a network like the Internet. After many trials, two basic sets of mechanisms and functionalities on the transport layer have been proposed by the IETF to achieve load sharing. These basic sets extend the protocol mechanisms that were originally designed for the use in singlepath dominated networks and represent only a first step to introduce a real end-to-end multipath transfer on the Internet. These first basic sets must be investigated and improved for the next steps. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) provide the basis for the two IETF end-to-end multipath extensions. Both singlepath transport protocols have a different historical background but similar goals. These can be characterized by a reliable, connection-oriented and ordered data transport. However, initial experiments with the IETF multipath extensions in real networks show unexpected and in some cases clearly inadequate results. It is becoming rather apparent that the singlepath transport protocol specifications with their singlepath goals have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the load sharing mechanism and, furthermore, that the severity of the influence depends on the topology. The new mechanisms for multipath transfer include, in particular, an extended “path management” and “scheduling” task. The mechanisms addressing the path management organize the new, alternative paths and the scheduling mechanisms sup- port their effective use. For both protocol extensions of TCP and SCTP, an interaction can be identified between the new load sharing mechanisms and the existing specifications for singlepath transfer. This thesis systematically identifies the impact factors of the singlepath specifications on the new load sharing mechanisms and demonstrates their effects. In addition to the focus on the optimal use, the fair distribution of resources across all connections must be taken into account in the IETF standardization process. This so-called “fairness” discus- sion is mandatory for a transport protocol in the IETF context and has a direct impact on the overall system performance. Furthermore, this thesis discusses the currently implemented load sharing extensions and analyzes their weaknesses. Moreover, in this work new design approaches are developed to decrease the impact.}",

	abstract = "{Peer-to-peer networks (P2P) are distributed systems that consist of equal nodes (“peers”). In contrast to classic client/server systems, there is no hierarchy or central entity: All peers offer services and use them at the same time. In the past decade, a multitude of different P2P applications has been developed – filesharing applications such as BitTorrent and eMule and communication applications such as Skype are among the most popular of them. Research has shown that P2P networks are vulnerable to different kinds of attacks. Known attacks include, e.g., the Sybil attack and the Eclipse attack. Traditional countermeasures against the attacks are replication and the usage of disjoint routing paths to reduce the probability of interacting with malicious nodes during a routing or storage operation. More recently, trust mechanisms have been proposed and analyzed for applicability to P2P networks. The existing related work mostly targets unstructured P2P networks – however, in real-world environments, the structured networks prevail. Especially implementations of the Kademlia algorithm are widely spread, as it is used by BitTorrent and eMule. Nevertheless, none of the trust-based approaches that aim at structured networks specifically attempts to enhance Kademlia’s security. Due to Kademlia’s prevalence, TrustedKad is particularly designed by the author to improve the security of the Kademlia algorithm. In this thesis, TrustedKad is introduced and its functioning is explained. TrustedKad rates the behavior of nodes after routing and storage operations as either positive or negative. To do so, it defines the rules by which inoffensive and malicious behavior is identified in dependence of the functioning of the Kademlia algorithm. Based on the ratings, routing and storage trust values are calculated to identify inoffensive and malicious nodes. Every node uses thresholds for these trust values to decide which nodes it regards as trustworthy. Non-trustworthy nodes are avoided during a node’s own operations. Furthermore, TrustedKad uses additional security features to further increase the security of the system. They are introduced in this thesis. In order to evaluate TrustedKad, it is implemented and analyzed in a simulation environment. The results presented in this thesis show that TrustedKad is able to distinguish inoffensive and malicious nodes. It counters miscellaneous variations of known attacks and improves the security of Kademlia-based networks considerably.}",

The expansion of MBB traffic necessitates the detail study of the characteristics of MBB networks with regards to network performance and reliability. It is observed that the literature towards the study of MBB performance mostly concern static scenarios. Therefore, in this thesis, effects of mobility on MBB performance are studied, and the QoS performance of Norwegian MBB networks under mobility are compared to provide a realistic view of the QoS characteristics experienced by the end-users. For this, performance metrics such as delay, packet loss, connectivity are measured for four operational MBB networks under mobility simultaneously using NorNet Edge (NNE), the dedicated testbed for experimentation and measurements in MBB networks. Measurements in different speed are examined to see how speed affects MBB performance. Radio conditions such as Local Area Code (LAC), Cell Identification (CellID) are also investigated to establish relation between the measured performance and physical locations as well as cell attachment and handover behaviors. Mode and Submode are also observed to see 2G/3G networks coverage and packet distribution in HSPA+, HSDPA, HSUPA, WCDMA and EDGE networks. The results of this thesis show that MBB performance is affected (degraded) by mobility, but degree varies with respect to performance metrics. It was found that MBB operators under mobility perform differently even though the underlying technology is same.}",

It points out that denial of service attacks could prove particularly disruptive and dangerous in a vehicular network. The project focuses on prevention, detection and mitigation of denial of service attacks in a vehicle platoon. To achieve this, a simulator was created using MATLAB and Simulink that can reproduce the physical workings of a vehicle platoon as well as the wireless communication between the vehicles and the possibility of malicious interference. Defence methods are implemented and tested against jamming attacks. These include methods of interference reduction, data redundancy and warning systems based on on-board vehicle sensors. The results presented are positive and successful in increasing a vehicle platoon s resiliency to attacks. It is the hope of the author that this work along with the simulating environment created, will provide an incentive for further development and examination.}",

	abstract = "{The explosive deployment of wired and wireless communication infrastructure has recently enabled many novel applications and sparked new research problems. One of the unsolved issues in today’s Internet – the main topic of this thesis – is the goal of increasing data transfer speeds of end hosts by aggregating and simultaneously using multiple network interfaces. This objective is most interesting when the Internet is accessible through several, relatively slow and variable (typically wireless) networks, which are unable to single-handedly provide the required data rate for resource-intensive applications, such as bulk file transfers and high-definition multimedia streaming. Communication devices equipped with multiple network interfaces are now commonplace. Smartphones and laptops are often shipped with built-in network adapters of different wireless technologies, typically enabling them to connect to wireless local area networks and cellular data networks (such as WLAN and HSPA). At the same time, wireless network coverage has become so widespread that mobile devices are often located in overlapping coverage areas of independent access networks. However, even if multiple interfaces are successfully connected to the Internet, operating systems typically use only a single default interface for data transmission, leaving secondary interfaces idle. This technical restriction is based on the fact that the majority of current Internet traffic is conveyed by transport protocols (TCP and UDP) that do not support multiple IP addresses per endpoint. Another crucial factor is that path heterogeneity introduces packet reordering, which can negatively affect the performance of transport protocols and strain the buffer requirements of applications. This thesis explores the problem of multipath aggregation with the attempt to find solutions that achieve increased data throughput by concurrently utilizing heterogeneous and dynamic access networks. We strive for approaches that support existing applications without requiring significant modifications to the current infrastructure. The exploration starts at the IP layer with a study of the IP packet reordering that is caused by the use of heterogeneous paths. Our practical experiments confirm that multipath reordering exceeds the typical packet reordering in the Internet by an extent that renders the usual reordering metric useless. The outcome of our network-layer study is a proxy-based, adaptive multipath scheduler that is able to mitigate packet reordering while transparently forwarding a single transport connection over multiple paths. After introducing a novel metric for quantifying the benefit of path aggregation, our analysis continues on the transport layer, where we investigate TCP’s resilience to multipath-inflicted packet reordering. While IP packet reordering is known for its destructive effect on TCP’s performance, our practical experiments indicate that a modern implementation is significantly more robust to packet reordering than standard TCP and achieves a substantial aggregation benefit even in certain cases of extreme multipath heterogeneity. In addition, we run a large set of emulation-based multipath experiments and identify several TCP parameters that lead to improved multipath performance when correctly tuned. Finally, we present an application-layer solution that builds upon the idea of logical file segmentation for streaming a single video to multihomed clients. The novelity of this approach lies in diverting standard protocol features (i.e., HTTP pipelining and range retrieval requests) from their intended purpose and using them for scheduling video segments over different paths. Interoperable with existing server infrastructure, our proposed solution can be deployed in a lightweight and purely client-based manner. We validate the proposed algorithms by implementing them into an existing video streaming platform.}",

The protocol is applicable to systems communicating via packet networks. Heterogeneous systems are enabled that include clocks of various inherent precision, resolution, and stability to synchronize. System-wide synchronization accuracy and precision in the sub-microsecond range are supported with minimal network and local clock computing resources. Simple systems are installed and operated without requiring the management attention of users because the default behavior of the protocol allows for it.}"

Even today’s LTE (Long–Term Evolution), which is designed to meet the demands of modern broadband Internet packet connectivity, nonetheless draws heavily on the legacy of cellular’s circuit–oriented origins. Its heavy reliance on fine–grained tunnels and hard–state signaling protocols, for example, imposes performance penalties and cost burdens that may not be inevitable if hard–earned lessons are incorporated in the coming years. In this paper we describe a fresh approach to cellular network architecture. Inspired by past and present ideas and experiences by others and ours, we propose fundamental principles to guide the development of efficient and flexible network architecture, able to serve the still unknown needs and preferences of future users. We offer an example of a network built on those principles and suggest how we can manage the evolution from today’s networks to an architecture better suited to the decades ahead.}",
