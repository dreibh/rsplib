# üí° What is RSPLIB?

[Reliable Server Pooling&nbsp;(RSerPool)](https://www.nntb.no/~dreibh/rserpool/#Description) is the new IETF framework for server pool management and session failover handling. In particular, it can be used for realising highly available services and load distribution. RSPLIB is the reference implementation of RSerPool. It includes:

* The library librsplib, which is the RSerPool implementation itself;
* The library libcpprspserver, which is a C++ wrapper library to easily write server applications based on librsplib;
* A collection of server (pool element) and client (pool user) examples.


# üóÉÔ∏è First Steps

## Ensure that multicast is working!

You need a configured network interface with:

* at least a private address (192.168.*x*.*y*; 10.*a*.*b*.*c*; 172.16.*n*.*m* - 172.31.*i*.*j*)
* having the multicast flag set (e.g. ```sudo ifconfig <dev> multicast```)

In a typical network setup, this should already be configured.

Ensure that your firewall settings allow UDP packets to/from the registrar (ASAP Announce/ENRP Presence), as well as ASAP/ENRP traffic over SCTP.

## Start at least one registrar

```
rspregistrar
```

See [Registrar](#registrar) for registrar parameters.

## Start at least one pool element

```
rspserver -echo
```

You can start multiple pool elements; they may also run on different hosts, of course. If it complains about finding no registrar, check the multicast settings!

## Start a pool user

```
rspterminal
```

If it complains about finding no registrar, check the multicast settings!
Now, you have to manually enter some text lines on standard input.

## Testing a failover

If everything works, you can test RSerPool functionality by stopping the pool element and watching the failover.

## Monitor the component status

You can monitor the status of each component using the Component Status Protocol monitor "cspmonitor". Simply start it by ```cspmonitor```. It will listen for status messages sent via UDP on port&nbsp;2960. The components (registrar, rspserver, etc.) accept the command line arguments ```-cspserver=<server>:<port>``` and ```-cspinterval=<milliseconds>```. For example, if you want a status update every 300&nbsp;ms and your CSP client is listening on port 2960 of host 192.168.11.22, use the arguments
```
... -cspserver=192.168.11.22:2960 -cspinterval=300
```

Note: You *must* specify address **and** interval, otherwise no messages are sent.

## Run Wireshark

You can use [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org) to observe the RSerPool and demo protocol traffic. Coloring rules and filters can be found in the directory <tt>[rsplib/src/wireshark](https://github.com/dreibh/rsplib/tree/master/src/wireshark)</tt>. Simply copy <tt>[colorfilters](https://github.com/dreibh/rsplib/blob/master/src/wireshark/colorfilters)</tt>, <tt>[dfilters](https://github.com/dreibh/rsplib/blob/master/src/wireshark/dfilters)</tt> and optionally <tt>[preferences](https://github.com/dreibh/rsplib/blob/master/src/wireshark/preferences)</tt> to <tt>$HOME/.wireshark</tt>. Dissectors for the RSerPool and application protocols are already included in recent Wireshark distributions!

# üìö Component Status Protocol

The Component Status Protocol is a simple UDP-based protocol for RSerPool components to send their status to a central monitoring component. A console-based receiver is ./cspmonitor; it receives the status updates by
default on UDP port 2960.

In order to send status information, the registrar as well as all servers and clients described in section B provide two parameters:

-cspserver=Address:Port: Sets the CSP monitor server's address and port.

-cspinterval=Interval: Sets the interval for the CSP status updates in
                       milliseconds.

Note: Both parameters MUST be provided in order to send status updates!

A. FIRST STEPS

How to set up a simple test of the rsplib-3.x.y release:

1. If, AND ONLY IF, you would like to use the sctplib/socketapi *userland* SCTP
   implementation, do the following two steps first:

 1.a. Get latest sctplib-****.tar.gz archive and install it by
      - Unpack the Tar/GZip archive
      - ./configure --enable-shared --enable-static
      - make
      - make install
         (as root!)

 1.b. Get latest socketapi-****.tar.gz and install it by
      - Unpack the Tar/GZip archive
      - ./configure --enable-shared --enable-static
      - make
      - make install
         (as root!)

2. Get latest rsplib-****.tar.gz and install it by
      - Unpack the Tar/GZip archive
      - If, AND ONLY IF, you would like to use sctplib/socketapi SCTP
        userland implementation (if unsure, you do *NOT* want this!):
        cmake . -DUSE_KERNEL_SCTP=0
        OTHERWISE (i.e. for kernel SCTP):
        cmake .
      - make
      - make install
         (Only necessary if you want an installation; as root!)

      Optional "cmake" Parameters:
      -DMAX_LOGLEVEL=n Allows for reduction of the maximum logging verbosity to n.
                       Setting a lower value here makes the programs smaller, at
                       cost of reduces logging capabilities (DEFAULT: 9).

      -DENABLE_QT=1: Enables Qt 5.x usage; this is necessary for the Fractal Generator
                     client! Without Qt, the client's compilation will be skipped.
                    (DEFAULT)
      -DENABLE_QT=0: Disables Qt usage; the Fractal Generator client will *not*
                     be available.

      -DENABLE_REGISTRAR_STATISTICS=1: Adds registrar option to write statistics file.
                                       (DEFAULT)
      -DENABLE_REGISTRAR_STATISTICS=0: Do not compile in the statistics option. In this
                                       case, the dependency on libbz2 is removed.

      -DENABLE_HSMGTVERIFY=1: Enable Handlespace Management verification. This is
                              useful for debugging only (makes the PR slow!)
      -DENABLE_HSMGTVERIFY=0: Turns off Handlespace Management verification. (DEFAULT)

      -DENABLE_CSP=1: Enable the Component Status Protocol support (strongly recommended!)
                      (DEFAULT)
      -DENABLE_CSP=0: Turns the Component Status Protocol support off.

      -DBUILD_TEST_PROGRAMS=1: Enable building of test programs.
      -DBUILD_TEST_PROGRAMS=0: Disable building of test programs. (DEFAULT)

3. Ensure that multicast is working!
   - You need a configured network interface with:
        + at least a private address (192.168.x.y; 10.a.b.c; 172.16.n.m - 172.31.i.j)
        + having the multicast flag set (e.g. "ifconfig <dev> multicast")
     even if you want to make tests only via loopback! Multicast-announces do not
     work correctly otherwise!
     If you have a dummy device, configure it appropriately:
     root# ifconfig dummy0 10.255.255.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 10.255.255.255 up multicast
   - Ensure that your firewall settings for the ethernet interface allow
     UDP packets to/from the registrar (ASAP Announce/ENRP Presence) as well
     as ASAP/ENRP traffic over SCTP.

4. Start at least one registrar
   ./rspregistrar
   See also Section D for registrar parameters.

5. Start at least one pool element
   ./rspserver -echo
   (You can start multiple pool elements; they may also run on different hosts, of course.
    If it complains about finding no registrar, check the multicast settings!)

6. Start a pool user
   ./rspterminal
   (If it complains about finding no registrar, check the multicast settings!)
   Now, you have to manually enter text lines on standard input.

7. If everything works, you can test RSerPool functionality by stopping the pool
   element and watching the failover.

8. You can monitor the status of each component using the Component Status Protocol
   monitor "cspmonitor". Simply start it by "./cspmonitor". It will listen for status
   messages sent via UDP on port 2960. The components (registrar, rspserver, etc.) accept
   the command line arguments "-cspserver=<Server>:<Port>" and
   "-cspinterval=<Microseconds>". For example, if you want a status update every 300ms
   and your CSP client is listening on port 2960 of host 1.2.3.4, use the arguments
   "-cspserver=1.2.3.4:2960 -cspinterval=300".
   NOTE: You *must* specify address AND interval, otherwise no messages are sent.

9. You can use Wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org) to observe the RSerPool and demo
   protocol traffic. Coloring rules and filters can be found in the directory
   "rsplib/wireshark" Simply copy "colorfilters", "dfilters" and optionally
   "preferences" to ~/.wireshark (or /root/.wireshark).
   Dissectors for the application protocols are already included in recent Wireshark
   distributions!

E. COMPONENT STATUS PROTOCOL

The Component Status Protocol is a simple UDP-based protocol for RSerPool
components to send their status to a central monitoring component. A
console-based receiver is ./cspmonitor; it receives the status updates by
default on UDP port 2960.

In order to send status information, the registrar as well as all servers and
clients described in section B provide two parameters:

-cspserver=Address:Port: Sets the CSP monitor server's address and port.

-cspinterval=Interval: Sets the interval for the CSP status updates in
                       milliseconds.

Note: Both parameters MUST be provided in order to send status updates!
